## Credits ##
[@pjreddie](https://github.com/pjreddie), thank you for making this course available to everyone.

Answers to most of the problems are the fruit of my reasoning. Also, I've got inspired by the world wide web, and particularly [@viplix3](https://github.com/viplix3) who's solutions helped me to understand some concepts and algorithms taught in this class.

## About ##

'This class is a general introduction to computer vision. It covers standard techniques in image processing like filtering, edge detection, stereo, flow, etc. (old-school vision), as well as newer, machine-learning based computer vision. It was originally offered in the spring of 2018 at the University of Washington.'' - https://pjreddie.com/courses/computer-vision/

In this depository you can find my homework and projects related to Computer Vision class offered by the University of Washington.

Please take a look at the homework and project sections, you'll find there all the instructions necessary to
visualize my Computer Vision projects.
