# The-Ancient-Secrets-of-Computer-Vision

In this depository I will post my homeworks and projects related to Computer Vision class offered by the University of Washington.

Please take a look at the homework and project sections, you'll find there all the instructions necessary to
visualize my Computer Vision projects. :)

## ABOUT ##

'This class is a general introduction to computer vision. It covers standard techniques in image processing like filtering, edge detection, stereo, flow, etc. (old-school vision), as well as newer, machine-learning based computer vision. It was originally offered in the spring of 2018 at the University of Washington.'' - https://pjreddie.com/courses/computer-vision/
